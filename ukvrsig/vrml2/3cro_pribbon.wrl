      title "This sample VRML file of a protein backbone ribbon of a DNA 
                 molecule is anchored to the VRML file 3cro.wrl. The 
                 NurbsSurface node is not part of VRML 1.0 but an extension to 
                 it. Thus only VRML browsers that understand this extension can 
                 read it. The VRML file was created at Imperial College by Omer 
                 Casher (o.casher@ic.ac.uk, http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/casher.html) 
                 with the help of two IRIS Explorer modules that he developed,
                 EyeBackbone and EyeRibbons, and a modified Render module. Full 
                 Information on the molecule itself is contained in the PDB 
                 file pdb3cro.ent. By extracting appropriate information from 
                 the PDB file, subsets of interest from this VRML file can be 
                 browsed."
